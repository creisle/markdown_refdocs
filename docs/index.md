# Markdown Reference Docs

This documentation (excluding this file) was generated by this package running

```bash
pip install markdown_refdocs
markdown_refdocs -o docs/reference markdown_refdocs
```

These files we added to the navigation configuration of the mkdocs config. Finally mkdocs was run
to build the files

```bash
mkdocs build
```
